<h2> How to play chess </h2> <!-- learning -->
<p> Chess is a strategic game that requires a great amount of skill (if you want to win).  The game is played by two people who each have 16 pieces.  There is a king, a queen, two bishops, two knights, two rooks, as well as eight pawns.  Each of these pieces have a unique way of moving.  The king can move 1 space in any direction; the queen can move any number of spaces in any direction; bishops move diagonally on either black or white squares; knights move in an "L" shaped manner; rooks move forward/backwards/sideways but not diagonally; pawns move forward one space at a time but can move diagonally to attack (pawns are allowed to move forward two but this is only for that specific pawn's first move).  The goal of the game is to put the opponent's king in checkmate which is when the king cannot escape from check (no longer can go anywhere without being attacked). </p>

<h2> Tips to improve your chess skill </h2> <!-- advice! -->
<p> Here are some ways in which you can improve your chess abilities </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Practice: practice makes perfect! </li>
    <li> Review: after your games, don't just move on to the next match.  Take some time to analyze your mistakes and see what you could have done differently. </li>
    <li> Chess puzzles: these will prepare your for scenarios that you may or may not encounter during your games </li>
    <li> Double check: like on a test, you should always make sure you didn't put the wrong answer before you submit it.  Before you place your move, make sure to think to yourself "is this really the best move?" "do I really want to move here?" </li>
  </ul>
